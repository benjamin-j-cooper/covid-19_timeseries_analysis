# covid-19 timeseries analysis

This is the repository for the raw .ipynb jupyter notebook for my timeseries analysis of the covid death rates using the John's Hopkins global Covid-19 death count dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antgoldbloom/covid19-data-from-john-hopkins-university).


The main jupyter notebook is the file 'covid19_analysis_clean.ipynb'

The .md file is the jupyter notebook converted to markdown format using nbconvert.

The assets folder contains the outputs of the figures from the analysis.
