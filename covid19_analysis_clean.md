# Forecasting US deaths per-day from Covid-19
### Without the rapid release of the Covid-19 vaccines and boosters

Time Series are a common task in data science. The possibilities for applying time series analysis to real world situations are endless. Think of all the different aspects of your life or business and the chances are if you think of them in terms of time, or occuring over a period of time, that they could be turned into data and analyzed with a time series analysis. Time series analysis, however can be challenging: making predictings into the future is difficult becuase no one can exactly predict the future. For one, unforeseen events or events with unpredictable outcomes may ocurr that could effect the dependent variable. Another way we can look at this is to ask, "what would have happened if X did not take place?"<br><br>

One such example of this in the real world involves the novel Covid-19 virus. With the fairly comprehensive ammount of testing and hospital record collection that ocurred  in the United States though the early stages of the pandemic, we have a high quality dataset with which to ask questions about the pandemic in the US and abroad. Here, I perform an exploratory data analysis of the global covid-19 daily death count data, and then conduct a time series analysis on the daily death count data in the US. The goal of the analysis is to forecast daily death counts if the mRNA vaccines and boosters had not been adminnistered.<br><br>

The approach I took was to break the US data into logical segments and analyze each segment independently. For example, the first segment I delineated spanned the time from the first record covid case to the release of the first booster. With the first segment, the training and testing data were split on the date of the realease of the first vaccine. I then forecasted daily death rates for the testing data set based on the data before the vaccine was released so the model would not take into account the impact of the vaccine on death rates. I repeated this process for the booster.<br><br>
